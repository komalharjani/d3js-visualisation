# Energy Sources Visualisation

The goal of this practical was to investigate how the sources of energy has changed from 1990 to 2018, considering the recent developments of energy sources such as solar energy.

## Running the Visualisation

To begin your journey in the visual, first run a local host (we used MAMP). Once that’s up and running, place the “infoVis-d3js” folder (found in the zip file) in your htDocs folder of the MAMP folder. Then run the following in your browser (we used chrome and mozilla): http://localhost:8888/infoVis-d3js/index.html

The visual should display and be interactive. Enjoy!
