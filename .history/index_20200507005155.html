            <h2>Welcome to Our Visualisation</h2>
            <p><b> Goal:</b> The goal of this practical was to investigate how the sources of energy has changed from 1990 to 2018, 
                considering the recent developments of energy sources such as solar energy.</p>
                <b><h2>Metrics</h2></b>
                <p><b> Amount of Data Consumed:</b> The y-axis contains the annual energy consumption in megawatt hours (MwH). For perspective, one megawatt hour is equivalent to the amount of electricity used by 330 homes during one hour, or the amount required to power 2 refrigerators for one year. </p>
                <p><b> Regional Analysis:</b> Since the data was aggregated by states, we decided to introduce a region variable which would focus on consumption by the main regions in the US. This is represented on the X-axis.</p>
            <p><b> Data Source:</b> US Energy Information Administration (2018)</p>
