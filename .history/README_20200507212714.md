# To begin our energy in the US visual, first run a local host (we used MAMP). Once that’s up and running, place the “infoVis-d3js” folder (found in the zip file) in your htDocs folder of the MAMP folder. Then run the following in your browser (we used chrome and mozilla): http://localhost:8888/infoVis-d3js/index.html
# The visual should display and be interactive. Enjoy!
